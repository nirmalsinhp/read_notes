# Data Model
- There are many different kinds of data models, and every data model embodies assumptions about how it is going to be used. Some kinds of usage are easy and some are not supported; some operations are fast and some perform badly; some data transformations feel natural and some are awkward.

## Relational vs Document
- Relational : data is organized into relations (called tables in SQL), where each relation is an unordered collection of tuples (rows in SQL).
- originates with business data processing, transactional processing & batch processing.
